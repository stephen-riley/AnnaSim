# ANNA+ Acknowledgments  {#anna-acknowledgments .unnumbered}

ANNA+ is an enhancement of the ANNA 2.0 specification and simulator (see
*ANNA 2.0 Acknowledgment*, below.) The additional instructions,
directives, and pseudo-ops were defined by [Stephen
Riley](mailto:sriley@seattleu.edu?subject=ANNA+), Adjunct Instructor at
Seattle University.

The intent of ANNA+ was to develop command-line utilities for ANNA to
expose Computer Science Fundamentals Certificate students to low-level
development tools, including:

-   command line assembler

-   minimal debugger in the style of gdb

-   VT100 terminal debugger

-   TinyC compiler

The utilities take the form of a dotnet tool that can be found at
[github.com/stephen-riley/AnnaSim](https://github.com/stephen-riley/AnnaSim).

# ANNA 2.0 Acknowledgments  {#anna-2.0-acknowledgments .unnumbered}

This document is based on the documentation provided for the ANT
assembly language developed at Harvard University, created by the ANT
development team consisting of Daniel Ellard, Margo Seltzer, and others.
Many elements in presenting their assembly language are used in this
document. For more information on ANT, see
[[http://ant.eecs.harvard.edu/index.shtml]{.underline}.](http://ant.eecs.harvard.edu/index.shtml)

The ANNA assembly language borrows ideas from many different assembly
languages. In particular:

-   The ANT assembly language from Harvard University. In addition,
    several of the simulator commands were ideas from the ANT tool
    suite.

-   The LC2K assembly language used in EECS 370 at the University of
    Michigan.

-   The simple MIPS-like assembly language suggested by Bo Hatfield
    (Salem State

> College), Mike Rieker (Salem State College), and Lan Jin (California
> State
>
> University, Fresno) in their paper *Incorporating Simulation and
> Implementation into Teaching Computer Organization and Architecture*.
> Their paper appeared at the 35th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education
> Conference in October 2005.

The name ANNA comes from Eric Larson's daughter Anna, who was 6 months
at the time when the original document was created.

Eric Larson would like to acknowledge to former Seattle University
students Seung Chang Lee and Moon Ok Kim who helped create the ANNA
assembler and simulator tools.

# ANNA Architecture 

This section describes the architecture of the 16-bit ANNA (A New
Noncomplex Architecture) processor. ANNA is a very small and simple
processor. It contains 8 user-visible registers, and an instruction set
containing 22 instructions.

## Memory Organization 

-   Memory is word-addressable where a word in memory is 16 bits or 2
    bytes.

-   The memory of the ANNA processor consists of 2^16^ or 64 K words.

-   Memory is shared by instructions and data. No error occurs if
    instruction memory is overwritten by the program (though your
    programs should avoid doing this).

-   ANNA is a load/store architecture; the only instructions that can
    access memory are the load and store instructions. All other
    operations access only registers.

## Register Set 

-   The ANNA processor has 8 registers that can be accessed directly by
    the programmer. In assembly language, they are named r0 through r7.
    In machine language, they are the 3-bit numbers 0 through 7.

-   Registers r1 through r7 are general purpose registers. These
    registers can be used as both the source and destination registers
    in any of the instructions that use source and destination
    registers; they are read/write registers.

-   The register r0 always contains the constant zero; if an instruction
    attempts to write a value to r0 the instruction executes in the
    normal manner, but no changes are made to the register.

-   The program counter, PC, is a special 8-bit register that contains
    the offset (or index) into memory of the next instruction to
    execute. Each instruction is one word (2 bytes) long. Note that the
    offset is interpreted as an unsigned number and therefore ranges
    from 0 to 2^16^ - 1. The PC is not directly accessible to the
    program.

## Execution of Programs 

Programs are executed in the following manner:

### Initialization 

1.  Each location in memory is filled with zero.

2.  All the registers are set to zero.

3.  The program counter (PC) is set to zero.

4.  The program is loaded into memory from a file. See section 6 for
    information about the program file format.

5.  The fetch and execute loop (described in Section 4.2) is executed
    until the program terminates via the .halt directive.

### The Fetch and Execute Loop 

1.  Fetch the instruction at the offset in memory indicated by the PC.

2.  Set PC ðŸ¡¨ PC + 1.

3.  Execute the instruction.

    a.  Get the value of the source registers (if any).

    b.  Perform the specified operation.

    c.  Place the result, if any, into the destination register.

    d.  Update the PC if necessary (only for branching or jumping
        instructions).

## Instruction Formats 

Instructions adhere to one of the following three instruction formats:

R-type (add, sub, and, or, not, jalr, in, out, outns, outs)

Some notes about the instruction formats:

-   The *Opcode* refers to the instruction type and is always in bits
    15-12.

-   The Function Code is used by the following instructions, all share
    the same opcode of 0000: add (000), sub (001), and (010), or (011),
    not (100)

-   The fields *Rd*, *Rs~1~*, *Rs~2~* refer to any general-purpose
    registers. The three bits refer to the register number. For
    instance, 0x5 (0b101) will represent register r5.

-   The immediate fields represent an unsigned value. The immediate
    field for lui is specified using a signed value but the sign is
    irrelevant as the eight bits are copied directly into the upper
    eight bits of the destination register.

-   Some instructions do not need all the fields specified in the
    format. The values of the unused fields are ignored and can be any
    bit pattern.

-   The same register can serve as both a source and destination in one
    command. For instance, you can double the contents of a register by
    adding that register to itself and putting the result back in that
    register, all in one command.

# ANNA Instruction Set 

In the descriptions below, R(3) refers to the content of register r3 and
M(0x45) refers to the content of memory location 0x45. The descriptions
do not account for the fact that writes to register r0 are ignored --
this is implicit in all instructions that store a value into a
general-purpose register.

    -   r5: return address at the beginning of the function call.

    -   r6: frame pointer throughout the program

    -   r7: stack pointer throughout the program

-   All parameters must be stored on the stack (registers are not used).

-   The return value is stored in r4 (stack is not used).

-   Caller must save values in r1-r5 they want retained after a function
    (caller save registers).

    -   The return address in r5 is treated like any other caller save
        register.

-   All activation records have the same ordering.

    -   Function parameters are pushed onto the stack, accessed via
        FP+*n*.

    -   First entry (offset 0) is for the previous frame pointer

    -   Next entry (offset -1) is for return address

    -   Remaining entries are used for local variables and temporary
        values (order left up to programmer).

-   Activation record for "main" only has local variables and temporary
    values.

    -   No previous frame

    -   No parameters

-   Alternatively, global variables may be stored in regular memory as
    labels on .fill directives.

## ANNA Heap Management 

-   Dynamic memory in ANNA is simplified -- only allocations (no
    deallocations)

-   Heap management table is implemented using a single pointer called
    heapPtr, it points to the next free word in memory.

-   Heap is placed at the very end of the program:

\# heap section heapPtr: .fill &heap

heap: .fill 0

# ANNA Assembler Reference

#   {#section .unnumbered}

## Assembly Language Files 

Assembly language files are text files and by convention have the suffix
.asm. Any editor (such as Notepad) can be used to edit assembly language
files.

## Assembly Language Format Rules 

When writing assembly language programs, each line of the file must be
one of...

-   blank line (only white space)

-   comment line (comment optionally preceded by white space)

-   instruction line

An instruction line must contain exactly one instruction. Instructions
cannot span multiple lines nor can multiple instructions appear on the
same line. An instruction is specified by the opcode and the fields
required by the instruction. The order of the fields is the same as the
order of the fields in machine code (from left to right). For example,
the order of the fields for subtract are sub *Rd* *Rs~1~* *Rs~2~*. The
opcode and fields are separated by white space. Only fields that are
necessary for the instruction can be specified. For instance, the in
instruction only requires *Rd* to be specified so it is incorrect to
specify any other fields.

Additional rules:

-   Opcodes are specified in completely lower case letters.

-   A register can be any value from: r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7.

-   Register r0 is always zero. Writes to register r0 are ignored.

### Comments 

Comments are specified by using \'#\'. Anything after the \'#\' sign on
that line is treated as a comment. Comments can either be placed on the
same line after an instruction or as a standalone line.

### Assembler directives 

In addition to instructions, an assembly-language program may contain
directions for the assembler. There are two directives in ANNA assembly:

.halt: The assembler will emit an out instruction with *Rd* equal to r0
(0xF000) that halts the processor. It has no fields.

.fill: Tells the assembler to put numbers into memory starting at the
current location. For example, the directive \".fill 32 0x41\" puts the
values 32 and 65 into memory.

.cstr: Tells the assembler to put a NUL-terminated string into memory
starting at the current location.

.def: Assigns a value to a label, such

### Labels 

Each instruction may be preceded by an optional label. The label can
consist of letters, numbers, and underscore characters and is
immediately followed by a colon (the colon is not part of the label
name). No whitespace is permitted between the first character of a label
and the colon. A label must appear on the same line as an instruction.
Only one label can appear before an instruction.

### Immediates 

Many instructions and the .fill directive contains an immediate field.
An immediate can be specified using decimal values, hexadecimal values,
or labels.

-   Decimal values are signed. The value of the immediate must not
    exceeds the range of the immediate (see chart below).

-   Hexadecimal values must begin with \"0x\" and may only contain as
    many digits (or fewer) as permitted by the size of the immediate.
    For instance, if an immediate is 8 bits, only two hex digits are
    permitted. Immediates with fewer than the number of digits will be
    padded with zeros on the left.

-   Binary values must begin with \"0b\" and may only contain as many
    digits (or fewer) as permitted by the size of the immediate.

-   Labels used as immediates must be preceded by an \'&\' sign. The
    address of the label instruction is used to compute the immediate.
    The precise usage varies by instruction:

-   .fill directive: The entire 16-bit address is used as the 16-bit
    value.

-   lui and lli: A 16-bit immediate can be specified. The appropriate 8
    bits of the address (upper 8 bits for lui, lower 8 bits for lli) are
    used as an immediate.

-   branches: The appropriate indirect address is computed by
    determining the difference between PC+1 and the address represented
    by the label. If the difference is larger than the range of an 8-bit
    immediate, the assembler will report an error.

-   addi, shf, lw, sw: Labels are not permitted for 6-bit immediates.

This table summarizes the legal values possible for immediate values:

+----------+----------+------------+---------+---------+--------------+
| *Opcode* | *Decimal | > *Decimal | > *Hex  | > *Hex  | *Label       |
|          | Min*     | > Max*     | > Min*  | > Max*  | Usage*       |
+==========+==========+============+=========+=========+==============+
| .fill    | -32,768  | 32,767     | 0x8000  | 0x7fff  | address      |

## Error Checking 

Here is a list of the more common errors you may encounter:

-   improperly formed command line

-   use of undefined labels

-   duplicate labels

-   immediates that exceed the allowed range

-   invalid opcode

-   invalid register

-   invalid immediate value

-   illegally formed instructions (not enough or too many fields)

# ANNA Simulator Reference 

The ANNA+ simulator may be found at
[github.com/stephen-riley/AnnaSim](https://github.com/stephen-riley/AnnaSim).
See the README there for build and installation instructions.

When fully installed, run anna to see brief command line instructions.

## Running the Assembler 

To write an assembly file, use any text editor (such as Notepad).

Then simply run:

anna your_filename.asm

The output will be an assembled memory file on the terminal screen
(STDOUT), which by itself is not that interesting. To write the memory
file to your hard drive, use the -m switch:

anna your_filename.asm -m your_memfile.mem

If you'd like to see what the assembled bits look like in the context of
your assembly file, add the \--disam switch:

anna your_filename.asm \--disasm your_filename.dasm -m your_memfile.mem

## Running the Simulator 

There are three modes for the simulator.

### Runner

The Runner is invoked with the -r switch. To assemble and run a program:

anna your_filename.asm -r

You can trace execution of your program with the -t switch. This will
show you each instruction as it executes, what register changed from the
instruction, and what the stack looks like.

anna your_filename.asm -r -t

### Debugger

The debugger is a very minimal console debugger in the style of gdb. To
assemble and invoke the debugger:

anna your_filename.asm -d

To see all the commands in the debugger, type h and press enter.

Common commands include:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  h                                   Help
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
                                      

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### VT100 advanced debugger

To run the simulator, there are four control buttons:

-   *Run / Continue*: Runs the program until a breakpoint or the program
    halts.

-   *Step*: Executes a single instruction.

-   *Reset Simulator*: Resets the program back to the initial state.

-   *Clear All Breakpoints*: Removes all breakpoints.

The simulator can be in one of five states:

-   NOT LOADED: A program has not been successfully assembled and loaded
    into memory. The simulator is inactive until a program has been
    loaded.

-   READY: A program has been loaded and is in the initial state (PC is
    at 0, all registers have 0, etc.). The simulator is active.

-   RUNNING: A program is in the middle of execution and has stopped due
    to a breakpoint or by stepping one instruction at a time. The
    simulator is active.

-   HALTED: The program encountered a halt, terminating the program. The
    simulator is inactive and must be reset to rerun the program.

-   ERROR: The simulator encountered an error. This is likely due to a
    bug in the simulator -- contact your instructor. The simulator is
    inactive and must be reset to rerun the program.

Additional notes:

-   When asked to enter a value using the in instruction, you must enter
    a 16 bit signed decimal value (-32,768 to 32,767) or hexadecimal
    value (0x8000 to 0x7fff).

-   Output values from the out instruction will appear in the output
    window.

-   The simulator will stop every 1000 instructions even if no
    breakpoints are set. This is used to check if an infinite loop as
    occurred.

## Displaying Data 

The Registers pane displays the current value of all the registers
including the PC.

The Memory pane can display the contents of up to four memory addresses.
To view the contents of a memory address, simply type the address in one
of the four address boxes. The current value will then be displayed in
the corresponding value box. The address must be specified in decimal
(unsigned value from 0 to 65,535) or hexadecimal (0x0 to 0xffff). The
value will be updated appropriately while the program runs.

## Setting Breakpoints 

Breakpoints provide a way to stop execution at any point in the program.
The typical use is to set a breakpoint at the start of an interesting
part of the program, and then to select *Run/Continue* to run the
program up to that point. The program will execute until the instruction
at the address of the breakpoint is about to be executed, and then stop.

To set a breakpoint, simply click the BP check box by the instruction
such that the box is checked. When the PC is equal to any of the enabled
breakpoints, the simulator will stop.

To clear a breakpoint, click the BP check box such that box is
unchecked. All breakpoints can be cleared by pressing the *Clear All
Breakpoints* button. Breakpoints are automatically cleared when a new
program is loaded.

# Style Guide 

## Commenting Convention 

Your program should include the following comments:

-   A block comment with your name, name of the program, and a brief
    description of the program.

-   For each function (including the \"main\" body): indicate what the
    code does and how each register is used.

-   Place a brief comment for each logical segment of code. Since
    assembly language programs are notoriously difficult to read, good
    comments are absolutely essential! o You may find it helpful to add
    comments that paraphrase the steps performed by the assembly
    instructions in a higher-level language.

-   A comment that indicates the start of a new section.

-   Place a brief comment for every variable in the data section.

## Other Style Guidelines 

This section lists some additional style guidelines:

-   Make label names as meaningful as possible. It is expected that some
    labels for loops and branches may be generic.

-   Use labels instead of hard coding addresses. You do not want to
    change your immediate fields if you add a line.

-   Do not assume an address will appear \"early\" in the program. An
    lli instruction with a label should always be followed with an lui
    instruction with the same label.

-   Indent all lines so lines with labels are not staggered with the
    rest of the code.

-   Use .halt to halt the program.

-   There is no reason to use .fill in the code section. There is no
    reason to use anything but .fill in the data section.
